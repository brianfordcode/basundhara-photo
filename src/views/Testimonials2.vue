The inaugural product line was shot by her and as I was just starting out myself, she was patient, organised and prepared everytime she came for the shoot to put me at ease. She was open to discussions, brainstorming photo angles etc and didn't worry about the time invested as her focus was only a great outcome. Her level of professionalism and attention to detail gave me the confidence in the quality of the end result. She went above and beyond to make the final pics just perfect and the ones that were not, she came back to a repeat shoot!!! I would highly recommend her!",
